I am currently studying software engineering and investing in online courses provided by TripleTen.Â 

At the beginning of 2024, I enrolled in the 10-month courses provided by Triple Ten, planning to have a career in programming. At the moment, I have learned the basics of coding, HTML, and CSS, andÂ I amÂ now getting introduced to Javascript as I completed my recent work AroundTheUs. I will update my work and resume as I progress into the course. Thank you.Â
